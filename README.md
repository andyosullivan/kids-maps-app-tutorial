# kids-maps-app-tutorial

Welcome! This is an iOS project, using cocoa-pods and Google Maps SDKs and APIs.
It's a fun app to allow kids to:

- See their location on a map
- Search for an address as a destination
- See how many minutes it'll take to drive from their location to the destination.

You can see the published app here: https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/how-long-until-were-there/id6444370974
